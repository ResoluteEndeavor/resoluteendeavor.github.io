							<h2>Complete Restorations</h2>
								<!-- Content --><h3>1969 Mach 1 Mustang</h3>
									<section id="content">
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										
										<p>This is a 1969 Mach 1 Mustang that was bought from an individual in South Carolina. Received as a roller with an engine and transmission on stands, we quickly went to work on getting the vehicle setup into a solid foundation that we could build on. Metal was stripped, sand blasted, and repaired in house. The 390 was sent to a Precision Engine II in Sylvania, GA to begin cleaning and blue-printing. Once the car was primed and the engine bay painted, the engine and transmission were slung into place. Once set, the car was wired using an American Autowire Modern Update Harness which allowed us to incorporate some modern day lighting increasing the overall safety. The car was test driven and promptly sent off to paint which a private contractor was hired to complete. Now this vehicle operates in our Car and Rideshare element strolling the beaches of Destin, Navarre, and Pensacola.</p>

							<h2>Restorations in Progress</h2>			
								<!-- Content --><h3>1970 Torino Cobra</h3>
									<section id="content">
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>This 1970 Torino Cobra was acquired from an Individual in Manassas, VA and is currently under the intensive process of being restored. Originally a 429 Super Cobra Jet, Drag Pack car, we received it without any drivetrain, interior or other parts. The search started for parts that would have been original to this vehicle. Once the majority of the body panels had been purchased, the car was media blasted and brought down to bare metal. It is currently awaiting to be primed so that prep work can begin. We are working on assembling a 1970 429 SCJ engine but are working on finding era correct parts before beginning. The power plant will be mated to a C6 transmission which it had from the factory.</p>

								<!-- Content --><h3>1965 Mustang Fastback</h3>
									<section id="content">
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>This worn-out shell of a car was purchased from an individual in North Carolina. Luckily the VIN was still in place and has been identified as an “A-code” car. (Letter codes such as "A Code" identified within the VIN indicate what engine the car was equipped with from the factory.) As evidenced by the picture, there is a ton of sheet metal work to be done before the car is established as a workable foundation. The process has begun but there is still much to be done. The plan is to place a modern driveline and modern suspension in the car so that it will have increased performance and safety</p>

								<!-- Content --><h3>1982 F100 Stepside</h3>
									<section id="content">
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>This 1982 F100 Stepside was the Resolute Endeavor's owner's first vehicle kept within his family till recently. Known as the epitome of endurance, equipped with a 300 cubic inch, inline 6 cylinder motor and 4 speed transmission, this truck is a force to be reckoned with.  It has withstood the test of time and still runs and drives even after being parked in a field for years. The vehicle will begin an in depth restoration over the next few months.</p>
