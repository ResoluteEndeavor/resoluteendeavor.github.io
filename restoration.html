									<h3>1969 Mach 1 Mustang</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic691.jpg" alt="" /></span>This is a 1969 Mach 1 Mustang that was bought from an individual in South Carolina. Received as a roller with an engine and transmission on stands, we quickly went to work on getting the vehicle setup into a solid foundation that we could build on. Metal was stripped, sand blasted, and repaired. The 390 was sent to a Precision Engine II in Sylvania, GA to begin cleaning and blue-printing.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic692.jpg" alt="" /></span> Once the car was primed and the engine bay painted, the engine and transmission were slung into place. Next, the car was wired using an American Autowire Modern Update Harness which allowed us to incorporate some modern day lighting increasing the overall safety. The car was test driven and promptly sent off to paint to a private contractor. Now this vehicle is a part of our carshare element and can be found strolling the beaches of Destin, Navarre, and Pensacola.</p>

									<h2>Restorations in Progress</h2>
									<h3>1970 Torino Cobra</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic701.jpg" alt="" /></span>This 1970 Torino Cobra was acquired from an individual in Manassas, VA and is currently under the intensive process of being restored. Originally a 429 Super Cobra Jet, Drag Pack car, we received it with only a transmission and a few boxes of miscellaneous parts. Thus began the search for replacement parts.</p>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic702.jpg" alt="" /></span>Once the majority of the body panels had been purchased, the car was media blasted and brought down to bare metal. It is currently awaiting to be primed so that prep work can begin. We are working on assembling a 1970 429 SCJ engine but are working on finding era correct parts before beginning. The power plant will be mated to a C6 transmission which it had from the factory.</p>

									<h3>1965 Mustang Fastback</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic651.jpg" alt="" /></span>This worn-out shell of a car was purchased from an individual in North Carolina. Despite the abuse that is apparent, the VIN was still in place and has been identified as a fastback mustang equipped with a 289 Cubic inch motor. </p>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic652.jpg" alt="" /></span> Again evidenced by the picture, there is a ton of sheet metal work to be done before the car is established as a workable foundation. The process has begun but there is still much to be done. The plan is to place a modern driveline and modern suspension in the car so that it will have increased performance and safety.</p>

									<h3>1982 F100 Stepside</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>This 1982 F100 Stepside originally equipped with a wooden bed and bench seat. Known as the epitome of endurance, it is equipped with a 300 cubic inch, inline 6 cylinder motor and 4 speed transmission.  It has sat in backyards and fields since 2013 but despite its abandonment, it still runs and drives with minimal effort.</p>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>The vehicle will begin an in depth restoration over the next few months. Again working off our established restoration principles, establishing a strong metal foundation is the first step.  There is minor sheet metal work that is going to be required to complete first. The next part will be working on the cosmetics of the vehicle.  The details of the final product are still undecided.  Pictures coming soon.</p>
